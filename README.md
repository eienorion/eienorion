Hi, Orion's here, a passionate and curious developer currently studying Informatics Engineering .
I love building things—whether it’s mobile apps, websites, or small experiments that push my understanding of technology a bit further every day.

Beyond coding, I enjoy:

🎮 Games & anime

📝 Writing and reading (especially Osamu Dazai)

🎵 Chill music and easy listening classics

My long-term goal is to work in the international tech industry and continue improving my skills through real-world projects.

I’m still growing, still learning, and always building.
